# EthioMart_E-Commerce_NER

## Overview

EthioMart is on a mission to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. The growing use of Telegram for business has led to the rise of independent e-commerce channels, which creates challenges for both vendors and customers. Managing multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication is inefficient.

To address this, EthioMart aims to create a centralized platform that consolidates real-time data from various Telegram e-commerce channels. This project focuses on fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER), which extracts key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from text, images, and documents shared across these channels. The extracted data will populate EthioMart's centralized database, offering a seamless experience for customers.

### Key Objectives:

- Real-time data extraction from Telegram channels.
- Fine-tuning an LLM to extract entities like product names, prices, and locations.
