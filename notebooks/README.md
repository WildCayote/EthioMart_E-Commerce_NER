# Notebooks Overview

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks focused on analyzing different aspects of data in a car insurance context. Below is a brief description of each notebook.

## Notebooks

### 1. `preprocessing.ipynb`

In this notebook I have included all my efforts to investigate the nature of the scrapped data and also preprocess the data with neccessary steps and prepare it for labeling.

### 2. `conll_labeling.ipynb`

In this notebook I took the preprocessed data and applied automated labeling functions that relied on regex.

### 3. `fine_tune_models.ipynb`

In this notebook you will find everything related to the fine-tunning, evaluation and selection of the LLM models used for NER labeling of new data. I have included task 4 activities, selecting the best model, because separating that piece of code block isn't worth it.
